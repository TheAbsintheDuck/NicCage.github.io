                <p>Nicolas Cage, born January 7th, 1964, is a man of many talents and even more haircuts.
                    He's been in over 80 films, including the critically acclaimed "Leaving Las Vegas" and the, well,
                    less critically acclaimed "Ghost Rider" series.</p>

                <p>Aside from his acting career, Cage is also an accomplished stuntman, shark wrestler, and collector of
                    rare albino pygmy elephants (he currently has 37 in his personal zoo). In his free time,
                    he enjoys playing the triangle in his heavy metal band, "The Wages of Cage," and writing haikus
                    about his pet alligator, Mr. Bitey.</p>

                <p>Cage's signature catchphrase, "It's not over till the fat lady sings," has been known to confuse
                    audiences,
                    as Cage is neither a opera singer nor overweight. But that hasn't stopped him from living life to
                    the
                    fullest,
                    as evidenced by his countless marriages (he's currently on his fifth) and love of kale smoothies.
